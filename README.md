Starting this repo to workthru the above tutorial as a project to learn React.js. This README is going to act as a personal log to jot down steps, notes, and thoughts about the process.

I've got Node.js and npm installed, so a quick use of `npx create-react-app` created a new React application in my project folder, 'react-hooks-crash-course.' After that did a quick `git init` in the terminal to setup my local git repo, connected my local repo to the remote repo, made my first commit, and pushed it up to the master branch. Then another quick commit to update the README, and we're off.
